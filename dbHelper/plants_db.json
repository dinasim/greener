Plants are very shade tolerant and this species has often been used to underplant in forests[11, 81], but growth is slower in dense shade[81]. Intolerant of atmospheric pollution[1]. Requires a generous rainfall and a sheltered position[11, 81]. Intolerant of windy sites[81]. The silver fir is a very hardy plant when dormant but it comes into growth in April and is then susceptible to damage by late frosts and aphis[185, 238]. This species is particularly subject to aphis infestation in many parts of the country[11], and is also prone to dieback and rust caused by fungal infections[238]. Trees are slow growing for the first few years but from the age of around 6 years growth accelerates and height increases of 1 metre a year are not uncommon[185].

It has been planted as a timber tree in northern and western Europe[50]. It is also commonly used as a 'Christmas tree'[61, 200]. This tree is notably resistant to honey fungus[11, 81, 200]. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, preferably between 30 and 90cm in height. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200]. Unlike most species of conifers, this tree can be coppiced and will regenerate from the stump[126]. Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. The cultivar 'Pendula' used to be widely planted for ornament, shelter and timber but because it is now susceptible to damage by Adelges nordmannianae it is seldom planted.

Plants are very shade tolerant[11, 81] but growth is slower in dense shade[81]. Intolerant of atmospheric pollution[1]. Prefers slightly acid conditions down to a pH of about 5[200]. Prefers growing on a north-facing slope[200]. Trees are somewhat shallow rooted and are therefore susceptible to strong winds[229]. Grows best in the Perthshire valleys of Scotland[11]. It does very well on glacial moraines in Scotland[81]. When grown in an open position, the tree clothes itself to the ground with gracefully drooping branches, though on the whole, this species does not grow well in Britain[11]. Trees have been of variable growth in this country and seem to be short-lived[185]. The best and fastest growing specimens are to be found in the north and far west of the country[185]. Growth in girth can be very quick, 1.8 metres in 35 years has been recorded[185]. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm in height. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200]. The crushed leaves have an odour like orange peel[11]. Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. This species is often confused with A. nordmanniana[11].

Another report says that it is an emergency food and is only used when all else fails[183]. An aromatic resinous pitch is found in blisters in the bark[64]. When eaten raw it is delicious and chewy[101, 183]. Another report says that the balsam or pitch, in extreme emergency, forms a highly concentrated, though disagreeable, food[269].

Another report says that it is a turpentine[171]. The term Canada Balsam is a misnomer because balsams are supposed to contain benzoic and cinnamic acids, both absent from the Canada oleoresin[269]. Turpentine is also a misnomer, implying that the oleoresin is entirely steam volatile. Actually it contains 70 - 80% resin, only 16 - 20% volatile oil[269]. Canada Balsam yields 15 - 25% volatile oil, the resin being used for caulking and incense[269]. It is used medicinally and in dentistry, also in the manufacture of glues, candles and as a cement for microscopes and slides - it has a high refractive index resembling that of glass[11, 46, 64, 82, 222, 226, 238]. The pitch has also been used as a waterproofing material for the seams of canoes[257]. The average yield is about 8 - 10 oz per tree[171]. The resin is also a fixative in soaps and perfumery[171, 238]. \"Turpentine\" is usually collected during July-August by breaking the turpentine blisters into small metal cans with sharp-pointed lids. Trees are then allowed to recuperate for 1 - 2 years before being harvested again[269]. The leaves and young branches are used as a stuffing material for pillows etc - they impart a pleasant scent[46, 61, 257] and also repel moths[169]. The leaves contain an average of 0.65% essential oil, though it can go up to 1.4% or even higher[269]. One analysis of the essential oils reports 14.6% bornyl acetate, 36.1% b-pinene, 11.1% 3-carene, 11.1% limonene, 6.8% camphene, and 8.4% a-pinene[269]. To harvest the oil, it would appear that the branches should be snipped off younger trees in early spring[269]. Fifteen year old trees yield 70% more leaf oil than 110-year-old trees; oil yields are highest in January - March and September, they are lowest from April to August[269]. A thread can be made from the roots[257]. Wood - light, soft, coarse grained, not strong, not very durable. Weighs 24lb per cubic foot[235]. Used mainly for pulp, it is not used much for lumber except in the manufacture of crates etc[46, 82, 226, 229]. The wood is commercially valuable for timber even though it is relatively soft, weak, and perishable[269]. Balsam fir is used in the US for timber and plywood, and is the mainstay of the pulp wood industry in the Northeast.

Prefers growing on a north-facing slope[200]. A shallow-rooted plant, making it vulnerable to high winds[229]. Balsam fir is estimated to tolerate an annual precipitation of 60 to 150cm, an annual temperature range of 5 to 12\u00b0C, and a pH of 4.5 to 7.5[269]. The balsam fir is a fast-growing tree in its native environment[229], but it is fairly short-lived and slow growing in Britain, becoming ungainly after about 20 years[11, 64, 81]. It grows best in the Perthshire valleys of Scotland[11, 185]. New growth takes place from late May to the end of July[185]. Trees are very cold hardy but are often excited into premature growth in mild winters and this new growth is susceptible to damage by late frosts[11]. Female strobili may be wholly or partially aborted up to 6 to 8 weeks after bud burst by late spring frosts[269]. Pollen dispersal can be reduced by adverse weather[269]. Trees should be planted into their permanent positions when they are quite small, between 30 and 90cm in height. Larger trees will check badly and hardly put on any growth for several years. This also badly affects root development and wind resistance[200]. Trees have a thin bark and are therefore susceptible to forest fires[229]. This species is closely related to A. fraseri[11]. Plants are strongly outbreeding, self-fertilized seed usually grows poorly[200]. They hybridize freely with other members of this genus[200]. The cones break up on the tree and if seed is required it should be harvested before the cones break up in early autumn[80]. Whilst the typical species is too large for most gardens, there are some named slow-growing dwarf forms that can be grown[238]. Whilst these will not provide the resin, their leaves can be used medicinally[K]. The leaves are strongly aromatic of balsam when crushed[185].

It is used as a healing and analgesic protective covering for burns, bruises, wounds and sores[213, 222, 226]. It is also used to treat sore nipples[213] and is said to be one of the best curatives for a sore throat[245]. The buds, resin, and/or sap are used in folk remedies for treating cancers, corns, and warts[269]. The resin is also antiscorbutic, diaphoretic, diuretic, stimulant and tonic[4, 171, 222]. It is used internally in propriety mixtures to treat coughs and diarrhoea, though taken in excess it is purgative[238]. A warm liquid of the gummy sap was drunk as a treatment for gonorrhoea[212]. A tea made from the leaves is antiscorbutic[4, 171]. It is used in the treatment of coughs, colds and fevers[222]. The leaves and young shoots are best harvested in the spring and dried for later use[238]. This plant was widely used medicinally by various North American Indian tribes[257].

Trees are very cold hardy but are often excited into premature growth in mild winters and this new growth is susceptible to damage by late frosts[11]. No other member of this genus has proved to be of as little value, or so short-lived as this species; there is scarcely a good tree in the country, though it is attractive when young[11]. Usually short-lived in cultivation, though bearing its interesting cones whilst still young[81]. Young trees can be handsome and vigorous, one grew 120cm in two years, but growth soon slows[185].

The bitter astringent bark is used in Mexico for precipitating mucilaginous matter and inducing fermentation in the making of alcoholic drinks[303 ].", "medicinal_uses": "Acacia angustissima is an important medicinal species for the Tzotzil and Tzeltal Maya Indians in Mexico. They rank it the 4th most important species in the cure of bloody diarrhoea and 7th in the treatment of mucoid diarrhoea. It is also used as a cure for toothache, rheumatism and skin lesions, and is reported to inhibit growth in malignant tumours. Tests also show that it possesses a mild antimicrobial effect on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus[303 ]. The medical activity will at least be partly due to the astringent tannins found in the plant[K ]. The bark of all Acacia species contains greater or lesser quantities of tannins and are astringent. Astringents are often used medicinally - taken internally, for example. they are used in the treatment of diarrhoea and dysentery, and can also be helpful in cases of internal bleeding. Applied externally, often as a wash, they are used to treat wounds and other skin problems, haemorrhoids, perspiring feet, some eye problems, as a mouth wash etc[601 , K ]. Many Acacia trees also yield greater or lesser quantities of a gum from the trunk and stems. This is sometimes taken internally in the treatment of diarrhoea and haemorrhoids[601 ].", "other_uses": "Agroforestry Uses: Although it may not grow into a large tree, it can be extremely valuable for use as pioneer species for rejuvenating degraded lands, and as a nurse crop for more valuable tree species. Its potential as a mulch producer has come into question, because of the presence of secondary compounds that bind the nitrogen and result in low quality (slowly decomposing) prunings. This may mean that the mulch is a poor nitrogen source for the present crop, but it may have greater residual effects that could benefit the subsequent crop, or be a good nitrogen source to help build up organic matter in the soil. These long-term benefits could outweigh the initial low nutrient return to the soil over a number of years. Slowly decomposing prunings may have value for suppressing weed growth in associated crops[303 ]. Other Uses: Tannin is obtained from the bark[46 ]. Bark harvested for its tannins should only be taken from mature stems, and only when the sap is rising at the beginning of the growing season - which is when the tannin content is highest and the bark is most easily removed from the wood[601 ]. Carbon Farming  - Industrial Crop: biomass. Agroforestry Services: nitrogen, alley crop.", "cultivation_details": "Acacia angustissima is a versatile plant that can grow from the warm temperate zone to the tropical zone. It succeeds at elevations from sea level to 2,600 metres, tolerating a mean annual temperature in the range of 5 - 30\u00b0c and a mean annual rainfall in the range 895 - 2,870mm[303 ]. It can tolerate quite cold climates with occasional temperatures falling below freezing[303 ]. Grows best in a sunny position. Grows well in free-draining, acidic, infertile soils[303 ]. It is adapted to a wide range of soils including vertisols of slightly alkaline pH[415 ]. A very drought-tolerant plant, possibly due to its substantial taproot. It can retain its green foliage in dry seasons that can be as long as 8 months[303 ]. Acacia angustissima is fast-growing, quick to mature and a prolific seed producer[303 ]. It flowers throughout the year in its natural range[303 ]. This ability to grow quickly and reproduce when young has resulted in the plant becoming weedy and forming thickets, especially along roadsides and in sandy soil in pastures in its native range[303 ]. This weed potential has created concern among some researchers about the advisability of its use in agroforestry or agricultural systems[303 ]. The plant responds well to regular cutting and to coppicing[303 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200 ]. When introducing A. Angustissima into a new area it may be necessary to inoculate with an appropriate Rhizobium before planting[303 ]. Carbon Farming - Cultivation: regional crop. Management: standard, coppice. For polyculture design as well as the above-ground architecture (form - tree, shrub etc. and size shown above) information on the habit and root pattern is also useful and given here if available.

The standard seed treatment for Acacia species (pre-soaking the seed in warm water for 12 hours) results in inferior germination. Scarifying the seed by scratching or nicking the round end of each seed with a file, knife or nail clipper (without damaging the cotyledon) before sowing has also been suggested[303 ]. Fernleaf acacia seems to fare better when grown from transplanted seedlings than from direct seeding. If it is to be directly seeded, then it is important not to sow too deeply. The seeds should be sown on the surface of cultivated soil and covered with a layer of soil equal to the width of the seed[303 ].", "other_names": "Carboncillo, Timbe, Timbre, Whiteball acacia, Prairie acacia, White ball acacia, Ocpatl, Palo de Pulque", "found_in": "Africa, Belize, Central America, Colombia, Costa Rica, East Africa, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, North America, Panama, South America, USA, Zimbabwe,", "weed_potential_section": "Acacia angustissima is fast-growing, quick to mature and a prolific seed producer[303 ].

Agroforestry Uses: In its native habitat, the tree is a colonizer of tropical coastal lowlands. It has the potential to be a pioneer species, but its tendency to spread into the local environment reduces its value as a pioneer outside of its native range[ 320 , K ]. The plant has a spreading, superficial and densely matted root system, which makes it suitable for stabilizing eroded land[ 303 ]. Its rapid early growth, even on infertile sites, ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen and tolerance of both highly acidic and alkaline soils make it popular for stabilizing and revegetating mine spoils[ 303 ]. Plantations of the tree improve soil physio-chemical properties such as water-holding capacity, organic carbon, nitrogen and potassium through litter fall. Its phyllodes provide a good, long-lasting mulch[ 303 ]. The dense, dark-green foliage, which remains throughout the dry season, makes it an excellent shade tree[ 303 ]. Other Uses The bark contains sufficient tannin (13 - 25%) for commercial exploitation[ 303 ] A natural dye, used in the batik textile industry in Indonesia, is also extracted from the bark[ 303 ]. The heartwood is light brown to dark red; it is demarcated from the yellow sapwood. The wood is hard, has a high basic density; is fine and straight-grained; often attractively figured; reasonably durable and finishes well[ 303 , 404 ]. It is excellent for turnery articles, toys, carom coins, chessmen and handicrafts[ 303 ]. Also used for furniture, joinery, tool handles, and for construction if trees of suitable girth are available[ 303 ]. The wood is extensively used for paper pulp. Plantation-grown trees have been found promising for the production of unbleached kraft pulp and high-quality, neutral, sulphite semi-chemical pulp[ 303 ]. A major source of firewood, its dense wood and high energy (calorific value of 4500-4900 kcal/kg) contribute to its popularity. It provides very good charcoal that glows well with little smoke and does not spark[ 303 ].", "cultivation_details": "The tree is predominantly found at low elevations in the seasonally dry tropical lowlands of the humid and sub-humid zones[ 303 ]. It is usually found at elevations below 80 metres, but can be found up to 400 metres[ 303 ]. In its natural range, the mean annual rainfall varies from 700 - 2,000 mm, and the dry season (i.e. Monthly rainfall less than 40 mm) can be up to 7 months[ 303 ]. The mean maximum temperature of the hottest month is 32 - 34\u00b0c, and the mean minimum of the coolest month is 17 - 22\u00b0c[ 303 ]. Frost does not occur in its natural range, but elsewhere, it tolerates light frost[ 303 ]. Requires a sunny position, it is very intolerant of shade[ 303 , 404 ]. Found most commonly on clay soils, it exhibits the ability to grow in a wide variety of soils including calcareous sands and black cracking clays, seasonally waterlogged soils, sandy loams and coral rag[ 303 ]. It can also tolerate highly alkaline and saline soils, pH ranging between 4.3 and 9[ 303 , 404 ]. It has brittle, easily-broken branches and therefore requires a position sheltered from strong winds[ 303 ]. Established plants can tolerate periodic inundation and are also very drought tolerant[ 309 ]. Often cultivated for timber outside its native range, the tree has escaped from cultivation in many parts of the tropics and has become an invasive weed in some areas[ 303 , 305 ]. Very fast-growing, an increment in height of 2 - 4 metres per year in the first few years is common even on soils of low fertility[ 303 ]. The optimal planting density is not clearly established. Most current plantings are spaced at 2 - 4 x 2 - 4 metres, the closer spacing being more suitable for firewood and pulp plantations[ 303 ]. The tree responds well to pollarding[ 303 ]. Young trees respond to coppicing better than old trees, but the tree does not sprout vigorously or prolifically. Best results are obtained if the stump is cut at a height of 0.6 - 1 metre above the ground[ 303 ]. Under favourable conditions, trees may reach a height of 15 metres in 5 years and produce an annual wood increment of 15-20 cubic m/ha over 10 - 12 years[ 303 ]. Recommended rotation is 4 - 5 years for fuel wood, 8 - 10 years for pulp and 12 - 15 years for timber[ 303 ]. Removal of lower branches and of young plants has been suggested as a means of improving stem form and of reducing the incidence of multiple stems[ 303 ]. The tree has a shallow, spreading root system[ 303 ]. Seedlings have the ability to compete with Imperata cylindrica during early growth phases and once mature may reduce the grass to a sparse ground cover[ 303 ]. Hybridizes with A. Mangium[ 320 ]. The plant flowers and produces fruit throughout much of the year[ 451 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[ 200 ].", "propagation": "Seed - requires pre-treatment to break down the hard coat[ 303 ]. Pouring a small amount of boiling water over the seeds (which cools down quickly and so does not cook the seed), and then leaving to soak for 12 hours is usually effective, as is making a small incision in the coat to allow water to penetrate. Germination levels of 40 - 80% take place in 6 - 15 days[ 303 ]. Treated seeds are sown in germination beds, and seedlings are transplanted into polythene bags when they reach the 2-leaf-pair stage. Seeds can also be sown straight into polythene bags. Young seedlings should initially be kept at 50% sunlight, but this can be increased to 70% once they have been established. In general, 3 - 4 months are needed to raise seedlings to a plantable size, 25 cm in height[ 303 ]. Seeds stored in airtight containers at room temperature retain their viability for several years[ 303 ]. Cuttings.

Its bushy habit to ground level and heavy fall of large slowly decomposing phyllodes enhance its value for sand stabilisation[1300 ]. It has given very satisfactory results when planted as the lower part of windbreaks with Eucalyptus camaldulensis[1300 ]. The plant has a shallow, wide-spreading root system that competes heavily with nearby crops and can reduce their yields[1294 ].

Acacia colei is a component of many semi-arid, subtropical to tropical plant communities in northern Australia, where it is found at elevations up to 450 metres[286 , 1300 ]. The mean annual temperature is around 25 - 27\u00b0c, rising to around 34 - 40\u00b0c in the hot season and falling to 8 - 16\u00b0c in the cool season. Light frosts happen occasionally in the most elevated locations. Rainfall is highly erratic, usually ranging from 230 - 725mm[1300 ]. Requires a sunny position. The plant is well-adapted to grow on infertile sandy soils that are not adapted to conventional food crops, and can also grow in claypans[1294 ]. Prefers a circumneutral soil, but can tolerate a pH ranging from 5.5 - 8.5[1300 ]. Established plants are drought tolerant. Acacia colei is a fast-growing but short-lived species, with a life-span of only 3 - 10 years[1294 ]. The plant can produce very heavy seed crops less than two years after planting and might have potential as a new human food in West Africa[1294 ]. They have been tested for toxicity and human trials have indicated that, at levels up to 25% of the diet, no anti-nutritional factors have been observed[1294 ]. Acacia colei has been used as an ornamental in west Africa, Thailand and northern Australia where its silvery foliage, mass flowering and wide adaptability to different soil types are highly valued[1300 ]. The seeds of most acacia species can be quickly and efficiently harvested at full maturity without the need for any specialised equipment, e.g. when a crop is heavy one person can harvest 3-5 kilos of clean seed of Acacia colei or Acacia tumida per hour. Small seed-bearing branches can be cut and beaten on sheets, or bushes can be beaten or shaken directly onto large sheets[1294 ]. In Niger, farmers prefer the curly-podded form (var. ileocarpa) because less seed is lost through shattering prior to harvest. In Australia the curved-podded form is preferred by seed collectors because the seed is more easily and completely dislodged from the pod during beating[1294 ]. Yields of 4 - 6 kilos of seed have been obtained from the plant[1294 ].

Along with the leaves and roots it is used for medicinal purposes[269]. Colombians bathe in the bark decoction as a treatment for typhoid[269]. The gummy roots have been chewed as a treatment for sore throat[269]. A decoction of the gum from the trunk has been used in the treatment of diarrhoea[269]. An infusion of the flowers has been used as a stomachic. It is also used in the treatment of dyspepsia and neuroses[269]. The flowers are added to ointment, which is rubbed on the forehead to treat headaches[269]. The powdered dried leaves have been applied externally as a treatment for wounds[269]. The green pods have been decocted and used in the treatment of dysentery and inflammations of the skin and raucous membranes[269]. An infusion of the pod has been used in the treatment of sore throats, diarrhoea, leucorrhoea, conjunctivitis, and uterorrhagia[269]. The juice of the bark is used in Nepal to treat swellings[272].", "other_uses": "Agroforestry Uses:\r In suitable climates, especially in India, Irag and the Mediterranean, the plant is grown extensively as a hedge and windbreak[82\r \r , 310\r \r ]. The trees have also been used for erosion control in sandy soils[269\r \r , 272\r \r ].\r A good bee plant - the flowers are highly attractive to bees[227\r \r , 274\r \r , 310\r \r ]. Other Uses: An essential oil called Cassie is distilled from the flowers[229, 269]. Cassie absolute is employed in preparation of violet bouquets and is extensively used in European perfumery[269]. Cassie pomades are manufactured in Uttar Pradesh and the Punjab. A deliciously scented essential oil, it has a fragrance of violets[245]. A mature plant 10 years old can yield 9 kg of flowers each year[245]. In a suitable climate, the trees begin to flower from their third year. The perfume is extracted from the flowers in form of concrete or pomade. Macerated flowers are placed in melted purified natural fat and allowed to stand for several hours. They are then replaced by fresh flowers and the process repeated until the fat is saturated with perfume. The fat is then melted, strained and cooled. This constitutes the pomade. Odour is that of violets but more intense. Absolute is prepared by mixing pomade with alcohol (2 - 3 kg to about 4 litres) and allowed to stand for 3 - 4 weeks at about -5\u00b0C. The alcohol is then separated and distilled over. The extract obtained is an olive-green liquid with strong odour of cassie flowers[269]. Mature trees can yield about 1 kilo of flowers per year[269]. The bark and the fruit are a source of tannin and used in making dyes and inks[227]. The seedpods contain about 23% tannin[240]. The bark, in combination with iron ores and salts, is used as a black dyestuff[269]. A gummy substance obtained from the young pods is used to mend pottery[227, 269]. A mucilage can be manufactured from the gummy sap[229]. A gum exuding from trunk is considered to be superior to gum arabic in arts[269]. The woody branches are used in India as tooth brushes[269]. In suitable climates the plant is grown as a hedge[82]. The trees have also been used for erosion control in sandy soils[269, 272]. Wood - heavy, hard, durable in the soil, close-grained. Used for fencing posts, agricultural implements, pegs, woodenware etc[82, 227, 269].", "cultivation_details": "Landscape Uses: Pest tolerant. Originally tropical, Vachellia farnesiana can succeed from the warm temperate to tropical areas, where it is naturalized at elevations up to 400 metres and cultivated up to 1,200 metres[307\r \r , 451\r \r ]. It is particularly well adapted to arid and semi-arid grasslands and wastelands[1093\r \r ]. It grows best in areas where annual daytime temperatures are within the range 20 - 32\u00b0c, but can tolerate 7 - 42\u00b0c[418\r \r ]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 400 - 1,400mm, but tolerates 150 - 4,000mm[418\r \r ]. It prefers a minimum temperature no lower than 7\u00b0c[238\r \r ]. Whilst this species is not very tolerant of cold, being damaged by even a few degrees of frost, the variety Acacia farnesiana cavenia seems to be more resistant to both drought and frost; and is said to be able to withstand short periods with temperatures falling to around -5\u00b0c[269\r \r ].\r Prefers a light sandy loam and a very sunny position sheltered from strong winds[1\r \r , 49\r \r , 89\r \r ]. Plants can grow well in pure sand[269\r \r ]. Most species in this genus become chlorotic on limey soils, though this species is said to have some tolerance[200\r \r ]. Established plants are very drought tolerant[200\r \r , 227\r \r , 245\r \r ]. The species and its cultivars are highly adaptable, and are reported to exhibit tolerance to drought, high pH, low pH, salty soils, both sands and clays[269\r \r , 1093\r \r ]. Plants tolerate a pH range from 5.0 to 8.0[269\r \r ].\r Acacia farnesiana is an aggressive colonizer and is regarded as an invasive weed both in parts of its native range and where introduced, notably in Australia, the USA, and some Pacific and Caribbean islands[1093\r \r ]. In Australia it is a potential weed of grasslands, invading trampled areas, particularly along watercourses[286\r \r ]. The plant has often escaped from cultivation and has been classified as 'Invasive' in many areas[305\r \r ].\r A fast-growing plant[307\r \r ]. In a suitable climate, the trees begin to flower from their third year[245\r \r ].\r The flowers are sweetly fragrant. Young trees produce up to 1 kilo of flowers a year[310\r \r ]. A well-managed mature plant 10 years old can yield 9 kg of flowers each year[245\r \r ].\r Although damaged by fire, the plant usually resprouts quickly from the base[305\r \r ].\r The plant responds well to coppicing[K\r \r ].\r The leaves are peculiarly sensitive to changes of weather. When a cloud obscures the sun the opposite leaflets close together and so remain until the sky brightens. They also close at night, the plant appearing to sleep until the sun rises[459\r \r ].\r This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[269\r \r ].

The seedpods are openly and strongly curved, 50 - 100mm long and 3.5 - 4mm wide, with very dark, brown to black, oblong seeds 4 - 4.5mm long[286 ]. Acacia seeds are highly nutritious and contain around 26% protein, 26% available carbohydrate, 32% fibre and 9% fat. The fat content is higher than most legumes with the aril providing the bulk of fatty acids present. These fatty acids are largely unsaturated. The energy content is high in all species tested,  1480 \u00b1270 kJ per 100g.

Many Acacia trees also yield greater or lesser quantities of a gum from the trunk and stems. This is sometimes taken internally in the treatment of diarrhoea and haemorrhoids[601].", "other_uses": "Agroforestry Uses: Acacia colei is a colonising species, forming dense regrowth populations in disturbed sites, including roadsides and burnt-over areas[286 ]. The plant can be used as a pioneer for restoring native woodland or establishing woodland gardens[K ]. It has been planted as a windbreak around fields and along roadsides. Its bushy habit to ground level and heavy fall of large slowly decomposing phyllodes enhance its value for sand stabilisation[1300 ]. It has given very satisfactory results when planted as the lower part of windbreaks with Eucalyptus camaldulensis[1300 ]. The plant has a shallow, wide-spreading root system that competes heavily with nearby crops and can reduce their yields[1294 ]. On sandy soils in semi-arid zones, the plant may be used in a wide alley cropping system (about 20 metres between rows) where its benefits as a low windbreak may outweigh its depletion of soil moisture in the crop root zone[1300 ]. Other Uses: A red dye can be obtained from the lipid-rich arils by soaking them in water[1300 ]. The heartwood is dark brown; it is clearly demarcated from the pale sapwood. The wood is hard, dense. It is suitable for the manufacture of small decorative articles, and can be used for light construction[1294 , 1300 ]. The wood is an excellent source of firewood and charcoal.

The seed are highly nutritious having 21% protein, 10% fat and 57% carbohydrate. Plants flower April to July in the southern hemisphere and fruit September to October. Acacia colei is a component of many semi-arid, subtropical to tropical plant communities in northern Australia, where it is found at elevations up to 450 metres[286 , 1300 ]. The mean annual temperature is around 25 - 27\u00b0c, rising to around 34 - 40\u00b0c in the hot season and falling to 8 - 16\u00b0c in the cool season. Light frosts happen occasionally in the most elevated locations. Rainfall is highly erratic, usually ranging from 230 - 725mm[1300 ]. Requires a sunny position. The plant is well-adapted to grow on infertile sandy soils that are not adapted to conventional food crops, and can also grow in claypans[1294 ]. Prefers a circumneutral soil, but can tolerate a pH ranging from 5.5 - 8.5[1300 ]. Established plants are drought tolerant. Acacia colei is a fast-growing but short-lived species, with a life-span of only 3 - 10 years[1294 ]. The plant can produce very heavy seed crops less than two years after planting and might have potential as a new human food in West Africa[1294 ]. They have been tested for toxicity and human trials have indicated that, at levels up to 25% of the diet, no anti-nutritional factors have been observed[1294 ]. Acacia colei has been used as an ornamental in west Africa, Thailand and northern Australia where its silvery foliage, mass flowering and wide adaptability to different soil types are highly valued[1300 ]. The seeds of most acacia species can be quickly and efficiently harvested at full maturity without the need for any specialised equipment, e.g. when a crop is heavy one person can harvest 3-5 kilos of clean seed of Acacia colei or Acacia tumida per hour. Small seed-bearing branches can be cut and beaten on sheets, or bushes can be beaten or shaken directly onto large sheets[1294 ]. In Niger, farmers prefer the curly-podded form (var. ileocarpa) because less seed is lost through shattering prior to harvest. In Australia the curved-podded form is preferred by seed collectors because the seed is more easily and completely dislodged from the pod during beating[1294 ]. Yields of 4 - 6 kilos of seed have been obtained from the plant[1294 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria; these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen.

The pale yellow sapwood is perishable[303 ]. The heartwood seasons well and takes a good polish[303 ]. Although a little hard to work, the wood is used to make decorative furniture[303 , 310 ]. Other commodities produced from the wood include poles, farming implements, carts, wheels, turnery, indoor construction timbers and flooring[303 ]. The utilization of this species is limited because its wood has irregular interlocked grain, a rough texture and is difficult to work[303 ]. The wood is appreciated as fuel and is suitable for charcoal production[303 , 310 ].", "cultivation_details": "A tree of tropical and subtropical climates, it is found at elevations ranging from sea level to 800 metres[303 ]. Tolerant of a wide range of temperatures, succeeding in areas with a mean annual temperature in the range 6 - 49c[303 ]. It grows best in areas with a mean annual rainfall of 400 - 1,500mm, succeeding even in areas where the dry season may persist for 9-10 months[303 ]. It can succeed in humid areas with a rainfall of 2,000mm, and also in semi arid areas with only 600mm of rain[310 ]. Succeeds on sands, infertile rocky soils, limestone soils, organic clays and in alluvial areas[303 ]. Requires a sunny position and a well-drained soil[310 ]. On fertile soils, A. Leucophloea seedlings grow quickly, up to 60 cm a year. Under irrigation, height growth may reach 7 - 10 m in 5 - 6 years[303 ]. Seedlings are light demanding and sensitive to weed competition, fire and frost. In order to exploit sufficient soil moisture, seedling root growth generally exceeds shoot growth. The trees produce a deep taproot and, once established, are very tolerant of drought, fire and frost[303 , 310 ]. Trees respond well to coppicing[303 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200 ]. It fixes atmospheric nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria which enables it to survive on infertile sites[303 ].", "propagation": "Seed - pre-treatment is necessary to break the hard seed coat. To encourage uniform germination, seed should be scarified either by submerging in boiled water that is allowed to cool for 24 hours, or by soaking in sulphuric acid for 10-30 minutes followed by soaking in cool water for 24 hours[303 ]. The visibly swollen seeds should be sown immediately[303 ]. Germination can still take 75 days[310 ]. Viability of dried seeds can be maintained for up to 2 years at room temperature[303 ]. When sown outdoors, the seed should be sown at a depth of 1 cm in lines 20-25 cm apart. Germination begins within a week[303 ]. Plants can be established by direct sowing, stump sprouts or seedlings. Direct sowing is preferred because the large roots of seedlings may hamper transplanting[303 ].", "other_names": "Akasia pilang, Arinj, Bilijali, Chalep deng, Haribaval, Hewar, Hivur, Hiwar, Jhira, Katu andara, Keo trang, Kikar, Nimbar, Pattacharaya maram, Pilang, Reru, Reunja, Ronj, Safed babul, Safed kikar, Shvetabarbura, Tanaung, Tellatuma, Velva-yalam, Velvel", "found_in": "Africa, Asia, Cambodia, East Africa, East Timor, India, Indochina, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Mauritius, Myanmar, Pakistan, SE Asia, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Vietnam", "weed_potential_section": "", "conservation_status": "This taxon has not yet been assessed", "expert_comment": "", "author": "(Roxb.)

It can, therefore, be very effective in preventing soil erosion. Densely packed plantations have proved effective in preventing further erosion, even on hillsides of up to 50 degrees slope[ 303 ]. The tree has been planted as a shelterbelt, a firebelt and as a shade tree in plantations[ 303 ]. An efficient nitrogen-fixer and good source of green manure, it thus can restore and regenerate soils[ 303 ]. Other Uses Wattle bark is the most widely used tannin material in the world[ 303 ]. It contains 30 - 45% (dry basis) high-quality tannins[ 303 ]. A powdered bark extract is also used to prepare tannin formaldehyde adhesives for exterior grade plywood, particleboard and laminated timber[ 303 ]. Possibilities of using the bark in the production of biodegradable polyurethane foam are being tested[ 299 ]. The heartwood is pale brown with a pinkish tinge; it is not sharply demarcated from the sapwood. The texture is moderately fine and uniform; the grain commonly interlocked; lustre is medium; there is no distinctive odour or taste.The wood is moderately hard to hard, heavy, fairly tough and strong, not very durable. It dries rapidly, but with pronounced warp, particularly cupping; shakes tend to open and knots to split slightly. It is moderately easy to work and polishes well. It is used for house poles, mine props, tool handles, cabinet work, joinery, flooring, construction timber and matchwood[ 303 , 316 ]. The pulp productivity is about 320 kg/cubic metre[ 303 ]. Testing has shown that it yields a pulp with good strength characteristics and is suitable for wrapping paper and hardboard. It is also used for rayon[ 303 ]. Originally distributed as a source of tannin, black wattle is now recognized as a valuable fuel wood[ 303 ]. The wood is moderately dense with specific gravity about 0.75, splits easily and burns well with a calorific value of 3,500 - 4,600 kcal/kg. The charcoal is extensively used in Brazil and Kenya, and in Indonesia the tree is extensively used as a domestic fuel and for curing tobacco[ 303 ].", "cultivation_details": "A plant of warm temperate to subtropical areas, it can also be grown at moderate to high elevations in the tropics. It is found at elevations from 300 - 2,440 metres in areas where the mean annual temperature is in the range 9 - 20c and the mean annual rainfall is 500 - 2,050 mm[303 ]. It prefers a moderate climate, exhibiting great intolerance to extreme heat or cold[303 ]. Its lower altitudinal range is decided by the fact that trees cannot stand high summer temperatures, and the upper altitudinal limit is based on the fact that the tree does not tolerate temperatures below 0c[303 ]. Winter frosts and cold winds during the early part of the rainy season affect growth and survival rate, but older trees can withstand mild frost[303 ]. Localities experiencing severe hailstorms and snowfall are unsuitable[303 ]. Flourishes in deep, well drained, light textured and moist soils[303 ]. It thrives in well-aerated, neutral to acid soils, loamy soils, soils derived from shale or slate and is highly intolerant of alkaline and calcareous soils[303 ]. Soils with lateritic pan close to the surface are most unsuitable[303 ]. Adequate soil moisture is a prerequisite for satisfactory growth[303 ]. Trees cannot withstand drought because of their superficial root system and high rate of transpiration[303 ]. In Hawaii, A. Mearnsii is a noxious weed and spreads prolifically at elevations between 600 - 1,200 metres in the 1,000 - 1,200 mm rainfall zones[303 ]. The plant is also showing signs of being invasive in other areas, helped particularly by its prolific seed production and the long viability of the seeds in the soil[413 ]. Trees begin to yield fertile seed from the age of 5 years, giving good annual crops[303 ]. The tree regenerates naturally from seed after burning in clear-felled plantations[303 ]. Seed may lie dormant in the soil for up to 6 years without loss of viability[303 ]. The trees have strong light requirements and respond to thinning in the early years. Growth rate is comparatively slow for the first 1 or 2 years. Thereafter, both height and diameter increments are rapid up to the age of 6 - 7 years, after which they fall off gradually[303 ]. The tree has low coppicing power[303 ]. Taproot development largely depends upon the depth of the soil, but the tree has the general tendency to develop a superficial lateral root system. Because of this, trees are liable to being uprooted by strong gales during the monsoon season[303 ]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria, these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[200 ].", "propagation": "Seed - requires pre-treatment. This can be carried out by abrading the hard seed coat to allow the ingress of water[303 ]. A more common method is to soak the seed in warm or hot water prior to sowing. There are various different variations, one common method is to pour a small amount of almost boiling water over the seeds - this cools quickly so does not kill the seed. The seeds are then left in warm water for 12 - 24 hours prior to sowing[K ]. A germination rate of 75% occurs in 7-15 days[303 ]. The sown seeds are covered with bracken fronds to protect the beds from excessive evaporation and runoff during watering. The bracken cover is removed after germination[303 ]. Seedlings are pricked out when they are 5 - 6 cm tall with 3 or 4 pairs of leaves, planted into polythene bags 13 x 8 cm, and watered daily until out-planting. It is essential to shift the seedlings frequently to prevent them from striking roots in the ground. The seedlings should be about 9 months old at the time of planting[303 ]. Seeds stored in airtight containers at room temperature maintain their viability for several years[303 ].

When dormant, selected provenances of the plant can survive temperatures down to about -10\u00b0c, but young growth is more tender and can be severely damaged at -1\u00b0c[418]. It prefers a mean annual rainfall in the range 200 - 400mm, but tolerates 100 - 500mm[418]. Requires a sunny position and a well-drained soil[418]. Succeeds in a range of soils from sands to clays and is very tolerant of low fertility[418]. Prefers a pH in the range 5.5 - 7.5, tolerating 4.5 - 8.5[418]. Established plants are drought tolerant[418]. A fast-growing plant when young, but relatively short-lived, usually senescing when around 15 - 25 years old[1300]. The plant recovers well following fire - both by producing a flush of germinating seedlings and also by resprouting from the base[418]. The main flowering period is from August to November with pods maturing several months later, between November and January (Maslin et al. 1998). Plants flower profusely, commencing at an early age and produce heavy pod crops during favourable seasons. The seeds of most acacia species can be quickly and efficiently harvested at full maturity without the need for any specialised equipment. Small seed-bearing branches can be cut and beaten on sheets, or bushes can be beaten or shaken directly onto large sheets[1294]. This species has a symbiotic relationship with certain soil bacteria; these bacteria form nodules on the roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Some of this nitrogen is utilized by the growing plant but some can also be used by other plants growing nearby[755]. Acacia murrayana, together with Acacia gelasina, Acacia pachyacra, Acacia praelongata and Acacia subrigida comprise the Acacia murrayana group of closely related species. This group of species is not far removed from the Acacia victoriae and Acacia juncifolia  groups[286]. Some forms of this species may resemble Acacia dietrichiana[286].

This can usually be done by pouring a small amount of nearly boiling water on the seeds (being careful not to cook them!) and then soaking them for 12 - 24 hours in warm water. By this time they should have imbibed moisture and swollen - if they have not, then carefully make a nick in the seedcoat (being careful not to damage the embryo) and soak for a further 12 hours before sowing. Acacia seeds that have matured fully on the bush and have been properly dried have a hard seed coat and can be stored in closed containers without deterioration for 5 - 10 years or more in dry conditions at ambient temperatures.

Very wind-resistant, tolerating maritime exposure though it is often wind and salt pruned in very exposed areas[4, 11, 17]. A fairly aggressive tree, it self-sows freely and inhibits the growth of nearby plants[18, 20]. It is often one of the first trees to colonize open land. It is fast growing and establishes rapidly. It can supplant native trees, at least in the short-term, though recent evidence suggests that in the long term it does not usually become the dominant tree in British woodlands and it is often recommended for planting in broad-leaved woods by the Forestry Commission, especially in windy areas[K]. Plants are subject to sooty bark disease - this is not fatal and occurs most often in years that follow hot summers[11].
